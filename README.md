# team-local-tactics
A game for the mandatory assignment

Team consists of:
Olesya Pasichnyk,
Lisa Maria Eliassen
and Thomas Ulseth 

### IMPORTANT:
Because of "match-case" use in most scripts, 
Python 3.10 is needed to run everything.

### How to run:
Step 1: Run server.py 

Step 2: Run database.py

Step 3: Run client.py

Step 4: Run client2.py


### Additional information:
- Extra functionality (in addition to MVP):
  - support for adding champions before playing a match.

- When choosing team, two clients must have chosen a team 
(cannot be the same team) before being able to choose to play, exit or add a champion.
- When a client has chosen to play, that client must wait until the
other client also has chosen to play, before they both are able to choose champions.
- Both clients must have chosen two champions before the match result is printed.


#### P.S.
All of us worked physically on the same machine, and therefore all the commits come from one user :)
